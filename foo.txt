2022-12-23: The combination of {iPad, WorkingCopy, Textastic, github} still works.  
  Python apps for the iPad:
     Pythonista still functions, but not updated in a couple years. I've stopped using it.
     Juno: runs local Jupyter, currently @ python 3.6.6, dev recently promised update.
     Tinkerstellar: 
2022-12-22: fix typo.
2020-01-27-2302: just a test note.

  testing iPad App "Working Copy" (aka WC). 
  make an SSH connection, over wifi,
  
  on WC, cloned ssh://{username}@{ip-address}/~{folder}/{subfolder}/.git
  
      note: the tilde ( ~ ) works, 
            but had to include that "/.git" at the end
