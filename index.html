<p> Thanks for dropping by.  However, I've no intention of building this into a "real" blog or website.  The GitHub/Jekyll blogging platform is architected for very simple static pages.  I don't have a personal interest in coding more complex website features from scratch, so I'll stick to using wordpress for blogging. </p>
